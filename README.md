# Data Structures


This project holds implementations of 3 different data structures: Counter, hashtable, and set.

Each subdirectory holds separate README.md's that explain each data structure and its implementations.
Each data structure holds files for testing inputs and their expected outputs.

To use: clone the repo and compile before running the executable.
